# Logical Expression Evaluator

This program is designed to represent logical expressions using an object-oriented approach in Java. The expressions can then be simplified, nandified or norified using the methods provided in the class.
### implementation
This diagram describes the relationship between the classes. The `val` and `var` classes repressent the values and variables that can be a part of an expression, there are binary expressions that get two expressions and unary expressions that get one expression.

#### Simplifications:
In the simplify method I implemented this simplifications, each expression has its own `simplify` implementation and it also calls it recursively on the sub-expressions.


- x & 1 = x

- x & 0 = 0

- x & x = x

- x | 1 = 1

- x | 0 = x

- x | x = x

- x ^ 1 = ~(x)

- x ^ 0 = x

- x ^ x = 0

- x A 1 = ~(x)

- x A 0 = 1

- x A x = ~(x)

- x V 1 = 0

- x V 0 = ~(x)

- x V x = ~(x)

- x # x = 1

- an expression without variables evaluates to its result. ((T & T) | F) ^ T => F.

#### Example
lets have a look at this logical expression:

`~((T & (x | y))^x)`

Where T is a value of "True", the ~,|,&,^, symbols denotes the "not","or","and" and "xor" operators respectively, and x and y are variables.
In our implementation, to create this expression we will do:

```
Expression e = new Not(
                  new Xor(
                     new And(
                        new Val(true),
                        new Or(
                           new Var("x"),
                           new Var("y")
                        )
                     ),
                     new Var("x")
                  )
               );
```
This logical expression can be repressented by this tree:

### Run Example:

In this run example I created this expression: `z A (x & (T | y))`.

Then, I assigned `x` variable with False value,`y` with True, and `z` with False. I used the `evaluate` method to evaluate the expression.

Afterwards I printed the `Nandify` and `Norify` result of the expressions.

And at last I used the `simplify` method and printed the result

### Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. Once you have installed the JDK, you can compile and run the program using a command prompt or terminal window.
1. first lets download the files from the repo using :

``` 
git clone https://github.com/OzAmoyal/Logical-Expression-Evaluator.git
```
2. In order to compile and run i use Apache Ant, please download it from [here](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) and then open your terminal in the folder of the cloned project and insert:
```
ant run
```
